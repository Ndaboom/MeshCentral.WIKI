This is a quick overview of what a running MeshCentral server looks like. After the login screen, the first screen you are likely to encounter is the devices screen. Here, you see all your devices. MeshCentral supports Windows, Linux, macOS and FreeBSD. Notice the battery indicator for devices running on batteries, and the blue connection icon on devices with ongoing desktop, terminal or file transfer connections.
